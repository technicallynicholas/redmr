# ReDMR

ReDMR is a react based single page static web application designed to simplify the process of converting csv labratory results into a csv eDMR report file that is compliant with state expectations for the monitoring and reporting of NPDES. The intenet behind the application is to reduce the process of reviewing and validating the form of data, and instead focusing on the quality and intent behind the data.

## Usage

The application makes use of the papaparse library to injest lab data with headers as a csv and then uses that data to populate tables based on reporting permit and sub-based on outlet number. It then presents a computed view of the min avg and max as well as any flow and unit conversions required using scientific rounding and notation rules that are configurable by the end user.

Any issues will be highlighted in cells for the users attention, and once everything looks good and a state format is selected the uploadable csv for state compliance can be generated by clicking the generate button.
